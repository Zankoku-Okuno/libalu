alignment operators:

upto:
    * take an integer and a power-of-two alignment
    * increment integer until it is a multiple of alignment

backto:
    * take a pointer and an alignment
    * decrement pointer until it is a multiple of alignment
    * useful if you are allocating blocks of data with header info at the start of the block; then any pointer into that block's data can get back to the header using this function

another useful operation is hoisting malloc into an aligned malloc:
    * allocate extra bytes equal to worst-case padding needed (alignment-1)
    * make the malloc with that padding
    * you'll need the original pointer around for later free
    * malloc didn't accidentally align the pointer correctly, use align_upto to adjust the pointer
